1. It looks like the various readability scores are different in their purposes. Some seem to show how "easy" text is to read. While others seem to show what grade of reading level the text represents. Those might have different purposes for different people that might influence the UX.
   1. Should do a little research to see who uses these scores and how.
2. I think it would be good for me to read a bit about VS code extensions each day for a few days before I start coding in order to acclimate myself.
   1. I am curious about things like: what are the available UI elements I can interact with in VS code and how? How do I read from a file, or from a selection? How do I install local extensions vs the marketplace?
